    <h2>Lamy studio fountain pen</h2>

    <p>I have been using a Lamy Studio fountain pen for the last year, it uses an identical nib to many Lamy pens including the Safari, so it writes almost exactly the same. This is largely a review of the durability of the pen.</p>6

    <p>I am a student and write in pen every day so it has seen significant use.</p>
