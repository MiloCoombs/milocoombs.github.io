        <p>This is a starter kit for <strong>strong</strong> design. It is intended to be enjoyable and informative for everyone: everyday people, technical people, designers, and nondesigners. <em>Emphasis sample.</em> One goal is to turn readers into great observers of the <s>absurd</s>, of the poor design that gives rise to so many of the <small>small problems of modern life</small>, especially of modern technology. It will also turn them into observers of the good, of the ways in which thoughtful designers have worked to make our lives easier and smoother. Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the other hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.</p>
