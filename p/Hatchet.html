    <h2>Hatchet</h2>
    <p>I found an old axe head in the garage without a handle and decided to make a new one. As I wanted to make a short handle I could use almost any wood for the handle so decided on some reclaimed oak. The tools used were a knife, coping saw, chisels, a hammer and sand paper.</p>
