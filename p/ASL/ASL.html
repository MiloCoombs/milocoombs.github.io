    <h2>Longbow</h2>

    <h3>Materials</h3>

    <p>The bow is made of oak and walnut sourced from old furniture, because I could not find a continuous piece of wood 1.85m long, the main stave of the bow is made by splicing two pieces of oak together with a scarf joint at the handle. (<em>right</em>) The forward surface of the bow (known as the back) was then laminated with 50gsm silk dupion fabric from a local department store. It was soaked in a generous amount of exoxy and clamped between the bow and a piece of pine covered in parcel tape to cure. This lamination is intended to stop splinters from rising in the back of the bow.</p>

    <p>Once the bow stave was made I roughed it down to the approximate dimensions needed with a plane and spokeshave. I then began to tiller it, this is a trial and error process explained far better than I could on many websites.</p>

    <h3>Handle and Nocks</h3>

    <p>This stage of the build is fairly self-explanatory. I just removed wood until the handle fit my hand, cut an arrow rest with a hacksaw and cleaned the whole thing up with abrasives.</p>

    <h3>Finishing</h3>
    <p>I finished the American Longbow. It was sanded to 220 grit and varnished with 6 coats of 50% thinned spar varnish. I also dropped the draw weight to a more manageable 40lbf. It seems to shoot nicely and is quite quiet.</p>
