    <h2>ESERO CanSat</h2>

    <a href="CanSat/1.jpg"><img src="CanSat/1.jpg" width=30% style="float:right;margin-left:5%;"></a>

    <p>Recently I have been involved in a school project called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CanSat#_Europe>Can-sat</a>; a competition where teams from schools arround europe design soft drinks can sized payloads to be dropped from tethered kytoons, drones and - for teams who reach the finals - a rocket.</p>

    <p>I designed the and made all the mechanical components of the glorified egg-drop. This consisted of a 3D printed and fibreglass composite payload fairing and the parachute.</p>

    <h3>Parachute</h3>

    <p>The parachute is a mix between the cruciform and anular shapes. It features a rounded top with a pull down apex (a bit toroidial), but has the square cross section of a cruciform chute. It seemed to be relativley stable in flight. The pattern was drafted by hand.</p>

    <p>One advantage of my design - that I didn't appreciate until making it - is that it is made from only four pieces of fabric. This was especialy convenient as all the parts for the project arrived three days before the launch.</p>

    <h3>Hull</h3>

    <p>Our design is focused primarily on robustness and simplicity. The shell is made from two layers of spread tow 200gsm fibreglass cloth - making it very impact resistant - and the flat top is of balsa-sandwitch construction for high stiffness. The components inside are held to the shell by four M5 aluminium studs. The same studs are cross drilled for the parachute connection which features a yoke designed to distribute the load evenly across the four studs regardless of the direction of loading.</p>

    <p>We also painted the can sky blue with grey stripes (we realised that having it sky blue only would be a bad idea). The veritcal stripes allow us to visually determine wether the can is spinning in flight (a problem we had in the last competition).</p>
